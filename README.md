# GoLangPhilly Presentations
This repository contains slides & code for talks given at the [GoLangPhilly Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/GoLangPhilly/).

We use the issue tracker to schedule future talks. Share what you have learned with the group. You don't need to be an expert to present.

Fork to add your talk under a yyyy-mm\title folder then submit a PR.
